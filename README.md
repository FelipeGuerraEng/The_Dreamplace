# The_Dreamplace


The Dream Place is a site that allows you to fund other people's dreams by purchasing tickets relating to the item using a credit card. It also allows you to post your own Dream tickets so others can participate and fund your dreams as well.

The site was developed following the Microservices architecture, using Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and integrate the application. Stripe was used to handle credit card payments. The services were built using TypeScript and Java. MongoDB and MySQL were used as the databases for the services.
